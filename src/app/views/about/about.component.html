<h2>The project</h2>
<p>The final project of SDA JavaScript bootcamp. An SPA dedicated to NBA fans, showing last news, scores, info about teams, players and search forms for further filtering of info. Uses Material, services, RxJs operators to elaborate data received from remote APIs. I'm continuously improving it. I initially designed the views in Figma, you can see the project <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/zXa5Q8IpAgz19Uqle2R4NH/Serwis-NBA?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=QtLDPxJ0HFTGQ87l-1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
