# My design on Figma

[version 1](https://www.figma.com/file/zXa5Q8IpAgz19Uqle2R4NH/nba-news?node-id=0%3A1)

# Goal

The NBA Scores app let you stay update with latest NBA game scores. You also have access to more info such as team roasts and players list. The app is powered by a free API. This app is my final project of the JavaScript course I've completed at SDAcademy. The design on Figma was done by my self. The plan is to improve it as my skills grow. More features will not be added, but I'll improve the existing ones.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
